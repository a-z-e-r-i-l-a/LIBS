This repository merely represents a sample of one of the latest analysis works of the author within python during employement at Fraunhofer IPM. 

The following image is an automatic spectrum analysis of one measurement. Peaks' annotation is sorted by their intensity. (Peak number 1 has the highest intensity in the spectrum)
- The left table illustrates the peaks' wavelength and their pixel position on the spectroscope line camera. (wavelength:pixel).
- The right table, for each peak wavelength, shows in which materials that peak exists, and shows also the intensity of that peak if the sample was purely coming from that material. (sorted from left to right)
- The middle table shows the fraction of peaks of the remarked material found in the sample spectrum.  (material| observed fraction of peaks from database: fraction of peaks in the sample belonging to this material.)
In this example: it can be seen confidently that the sample has Titanium.
